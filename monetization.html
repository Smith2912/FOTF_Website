                100% of the contributions that are made are put back into The Fusion Of The Forbidden by paying monthly server costs, advertising and future developments. We do not promote "pay to win" and therefore we do not offer over powered/game breaking contribution perks in any of our servers.
            </p>
            <p>
                All Contributions are final and are used to achieve goals within the server. All contributions are for server gain only. By contributing to the server you automatically agree with our terms of service and forfeit any PayPal disputes. All payments are final at the point of purchase.
            </p>
            <p>
                Due to Monetization restrictions we do not offer Priority Ques. The Fusion Of The Forbidden is Approved by respected mod and map developers for monetization use.
            </p>
            <p>
                Under no circumstances will items or packages be offered that are not listed above. We are anti pay to win or paying to gain any advantage including games that do not have monetization regulations.
